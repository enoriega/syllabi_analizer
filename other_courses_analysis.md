For instance, courses like ESOC 314 and ESOC 317 delve into media theory and the ethical dimensions of digital information, respectively, which are critical to understanding the broader context of technology but do not involve the application of AI or data science methodologies.

Despite their varied subjects, these courses share a common thread in their emphasis on the intersection of technology with cultural, ethical, and creative domains. They explore how digital media, information ethics, and creative coding influence society and individual expression, rather than focusing on the technical skills associated with AI or data science. This thematic focus on societal implications, creativity, and ethical considerations distinguishes them from core AI and data science courses, which are typically centered on quantitative analysis, algorithm development, and data manipulation.

Regarding potential misclassification, it is possible that courses like LIS 529, which explores AI in the context of learning and design, could be considered for reclassification. While it does not fit neatly into traditional AI or data science categories, its focus on the application of AI principles in educational contexts may warrant a closer examination to determine if it aligns more closely with applied AI. However, the course’s emphasis on theoretical and practical aspects rather than technical training suggests that its classification as "Other" may still be appropriate. Overall, the classification reflects a thoughtful distinction between courses that engage with AI and data science concepts and those that explore the broader implications of technology in society.

### Law (5 courses)

The courses classified as "Other" from the Law offering unit do not fit into the AI or Data Science categories primarily because their core content revolves around legal principles, ethics, and regulatory frameworks rather than the application or development of AI and data science techniques. For instance, LAW 655E focuses on technology law and policy, specifically the U.S. Patent Act, which is rooted in legal theory rather than computational methods. Similarly, LAW 575A and LAW 580C address ethical considerations in clinical research and the legal aspects of health information technology, respectively, both of which are essential for understanding the legal landscape but do not engage with AI or data science methodologies. Even LAW 689D, while it mentions AI and Big Data, primarily hones in on legal research skills rather than the technical or analytical aspects of these fields.

What these courses have in common is their emphasis on the intersection of law and technology, particularly in how legal frameworks adapt to advancements in technology. They explore the implications of technology on legal practice and ethical considerations, which is crucial for legal professionals in an increasingly digital world. However, they do not delve into the technical aspects of AI or data science, such as algorithm development, data analysis, or machine learning applications, which are the hallmarks of the core and applied categories in AI and data science.

Regarding potential misclassification, LAW 689D might warrant a closer examination. Although it is primarily focused on legal research methodologies, the course's title suggests a significant engagement with AI and Big Data, which could imply a more interdisciplinary approach. If the course content includes substantial discussions on how AI and data science influence legal practices or case law, it may be more appropriate to classify it under Applied AI or Applied Data Science. However, if the focus remains predominantly on legal research without integrating AI techniques, its classification as "Other" remains justified.

### Philosophy (4 courses)

The courses classified as "Other" from the Philosophy offering unit do not fit into the AI or Data Science categories primarily because they emphasize theoretical, ethical, and philosophical discussions rather than practical applications or technical methodologies associated with AI and Data Science. For instance, courses like "Philosophy and Artificial Intelligence" and "Ethics of Artificial Intelligence" delve into the implications and ethical considerations of AI technologies, which are critical aspects of the discourse surrounding AI but do not involve the hands-on application of AI techniques or data analysis. Similarly, "Consciousness and Cognition" focuses on philosophical inquiries about the nature of consciousness and cognition, which, while relevant to discussions about AI, do not engage with the technical aspects of AI or Data Science.

What these courses have in common is their philosophical lens through which they examine concepts related to artificial intelligence and cognition. They all prioritize critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and theoretical exploration over the technical skills typically associated with core AI or Data Science curricula. This shared focus on philosophical inquiry allows students to engage with foundational questions about intelligence, consciousness, and the ethical ramifications of technology, rather than equipping them with the practical skills necessary for AI development or data analysis.

While the classification seems appropriate for most of these courses, "Philosophy and Artificial Intelligence" (CSC 455 / PHIL 455) and "Philosophy and Artificial Intelligence" (COGS 555 / CSC 555 / PHIL 555) could be argued to have a closer connection to AI due to their explicit mention of AI in the title. However, since both courses focus on philosophical implications rather than practical applications, their classification as "Other" remains justified. Overall, the classification reflects a clear distinction between theoretical exploration and applied technical training, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of academic categorization in AI and Data Science.

### English (3 courses)

The courses classified as "Other" from the English offering unit do not fit into the categories of Core AI, Applied AI, Core Data Science, or Applied Data Science primarily because their content and objectives are centered around linguistic and literary studies rather than computational or analytical methodologies associated with AI and data science. For instance, ENGL 406 and ENGL 506 focus on the intricacies of English grammar and linguistics, which are foundational aspects of language studies but do not engage with the algorithmic or statistical approaches that characterize AI and data science. Similarly, ENGL 325/ESOC 325 examines the relationship between contemporary literature and digital media, emphasizing cultural and artistic expression rather than the quantitative or technical aspects of data analysis or machine learning.

What these courses have in common is their emphasis on language, communication, and cultural studies. They explore theoretical frameworks and practical applications within the humanities, focusing on how language and media shape human experience and understanding. This shared focus on qualitative analysis and critical thinking distinguishes them from the more quantitative, data-driven nature of AI and data science courses, which typically involve programming, statistical modeling, and algorithm development.

Regarding potential misclassification, it is unlikely that any of these courses were misclassified, as their content clearly aligns with the humanities rather than the technical fields of AI or data science. However, ENGL 325/ESOC 325 could be argued to have some relevance to data science in terms of analyzing digital media trends or user engagement metrics; yet, its primary focus remains on literary analysis rather than data analytics. Thus, while it may touch on themes relevant to data science, it does not engage with the core principles or methodologies of the field, justifying its classification as "Other."

### Mathematics (3 courses)

The courses classified as "Other" from the Mathematics offering unit do not fit into the categories of Core AI, Applied AI, Core Data Science, or Applied Data Science primarily because they emphasize foundational mathematical principles and career preparation rather than the application or development of AI and data science techniques. DATA 395M / MATH 395M is centered on career exploration, focusing on preparing students for professional paths rather than imparting specific skills or methodologies related to AI or data science. Similarly, APPL 581B / MATH 581B and APPL 589B / MATH 589B delve into advanced mathematical methods and algorithms, which, while crucial for understanding the theoretical underpinnings of AI and data science, do not directly engage with the practical applications or computational techniques characteristic of these fields.

Despite their classification as "Other," these courses share a commonality in their focus on mathematical theory and its applications outside the immediate context of AI and data science. They provide students with essential mathematical tools and frameworks that can be beneficial in various scientific and engineering domains, but they do not engage with the specific methodologies or technologies that define AI and data science. This distinction is critical, as the courses are designed to enhance mathematical literacy and problem-solving skills rather than to teach students how to implement AI algorithms or analyze data sets.

Regarding potential misclassification, APPL 589B / MATH 589B could be argued to have relevance to data science, as algorithms are fundamental to both fields. However, the course's focus on applied mathematics rather than data-centric algorithms suggests that it does not align closely enough with the practical applications of data science to warrant reclassification. Therefore, while there may be some overlap in content, the courses' emphases on theoretical mathematics and career preparation justify their classification as "Other."

### Electrical & Computer Engr (3 courses)

The courses classified as "Other" from the Electrical & Computer Engineering offering unit do not fit into the AI or Data Science categories primarily due to their focus on engineering principles and system architecture rather than the application of AI or data science methodologies. For instance, ECE 569 emphasizes high-performance computing systems and architectures, which, while potentially relevant to AI applications, centers more on the underlying technology and algorithms necessary for efficient computing rather than on AI techniques themselves. Similarly, ECE 576A is concerned with the design and optimization of embedded systems, focusing on hardware-software integration rather than the application of AI or data science concepts. Lastly, SFWE 511 deals with software for industrial control systems, which is largely about control theory and system management, again lacking a direct connection to AI or data science.

Despite their classification as "Other," these courses share a commonality in their focus on the engineering and technological foundations necessary for advanced computing and control systems. They emphasize the principles of system design, optimization, and performance, which are crucial for developing robust computing environments but do not delve into the predictive modeling, data analysis, or machine learning aspects that characterize core AI and data science courses. This classification highlights a clear distinction between courses that are fundamentally about the technology enabling AI and data science versus those that apply AI and data science techniques.

In terms of misclassification, ECE 569 could be argued to have some relevance to AI due to its mention of neural networks, which are a fundamental component of AI. However, since the course's primary focus is on computing architecture rather than AI applications, its classification as "Other" remains appropriate. The other two courses, ECE 576A and SFWE 511, are less likely to be misclassified as they are firmly rooted in engineering practices that do not engage with AI or data science concepts. Overall, the classification appears to be justified based on the courses' content and objectives.

### Global Studies, Sch of (2 courses)

The courses classified as "Other" from the Global Studies offering unit do not fit into the AI or Data Science categories primarily because they focus on the socio-cultural implications of technology rather than on the technical aspects of AI or data science. GLS 260 / GWS 260 examines how sex, gender, and technology intersect, emphasizing cultural and societal norms that shape these relationships. Similarly, HRTS 598A delves into the implications of technology within the realm of human rights, exploring ethical considerations and societal impacts rather than engaging with the methodologies or techniques characteristic of AI or data science. Both courses prioritize critical analysis and theoretical frameworks over the quantitative or algorithmic focus typical of core AI and data science curricula.

Despite their classification as "Other," these courses share a common theme of exploring the societal implications of technology. They encourage students to think critically about how technology interacts with various aspects of human experience, including gender and human rights. This focus on the ethical, cultural, and societal dimensions of technology distinguishes them from more technical courses, which are typically centered on the development and application of AI and data science skills. 

In terms of potential misclassification, it is unlikely that either course should be reclassified into the AI or Data Science categories, as their primary focus remains on the implications of technology rather than on the technical competencies associated with AI or data science. However, there could be an argument for a subcategory that encompasses courses addressing the ethical and societal impacts of technology, which could provide a more nuanced classification for such interdisciplinary courses that engage with technology in a critical context.

### Sociology, Sch of (2 courses)

The courses classified as "Other" from the Sociology School do not fit into the categories of Core AI, Applied AI, Core Data Science, or Applied Data Science primarily due to their focus on qualitative and theoretical frameworks rather than quantitative data analysis or computational techniques that are central to AI and data science disciplines. SOC 471 emphasizes qualitative research methods, which are inherently non-statistical and do not engage with the algorithmic or computational paradigms that define AI and data science. Similarly, SOC 501, while it touches on computational methods, does not prioritize AI or data science applications but rather explores theoretical frameworks and methodologies pertinent to the social sciences, thus distancing itself from the core tenets of data-centric disciplines.

Despite their classification as "Other," both courses share a commonality in their emphasis on methodological rigor and theoretical exploration within the sociological context. They prioritize understanding human behavior and social phenomena through qualitative and computational lenses, which are crucial for sociological inquiry but do not align with the quantitative and algorithm-driven focus of AI and data science. This distinction highlights the courses' commitment to exploring social dynamics and research methodologies rather than engaging with the technological aspects of data analysis or machine learning.

In terms of misclassification, SOC 501 could be argued to have a closer relationship with applied data science than SOC 471, given its focus on computational methods. However, the course's emphasis on theoretical approaches suggests that it is more about the intersection of social science and computation rather than a direct application of data science techniques. Therefore, while SOC 501 might warrant reconsideration for a different classification, it ultimately remains distinct enough from core AI and data science to justify its placement in the "Other" category.

### Molecular & Cellular Biology (2 courses)

The courses MCB 195B - Genomic Medicine Colloquium and MCB 493C - Internship: Systems and Big Data Biology have been classified as "Other" because they do not primarily focus on the core principles or applications of artificial intelligence (AI) or data science. MCB 195B centers around the implications of genomics in the medical field, emphasizing career exploration and strategies within molecular biology rather than the computational or analytical techniques characteristic of AI or data science. Similarly, MCB 493C is an internship course that provides practical experience in a professional setting, which, while it may involve data, does not delve into the theoretical frameworks or methodologies of AI or data science. Instead, it is more about applying biological knowledge in real-world scenarios rather than analyzing or interpreting data through AI or data science lenses.

Both courses share a commonality in their focus on the biological sciences and practical applications within the field of molecular and cellular biology. They emphasize the integration of biological knowledge with real-world contexts—whether through discussions on genomic medicine or through hands-on internship experiences. This orientation towards biological applications rather than computational techniques is a key reason for their classification as "Other." The courses are designed to prepare students for careers in biology and medicine, rather than equipping them with the skills to engage directly with AI or data science methodologies.

Regarding potential misclassification, MCB 493C might warrant further consideration. While it is primarily an internship course, if the internship involves significant engagement with data analysis techniques or AI applications in biological contexts, it could be argued that it fits within the Applied Data Science category. However, without explicit evidence that the course emphasizes these aspects, it remains appropriately classified as "Other." Overall, the classification reflects the courses' focus on biological applications rather than the computational or analytical frameworks central to AI and data science.

### Mining Engr & Mineral Res, Sch (2 courses)

The courses MIN 496 and MIN 396 from the Mining Engineering & Mineral Resources School have been classified as "Other" because they do not primarily engage with the foundational principles or applications of artificial intelligence (AI) or data science. Instead, these courses focus on specialized topics pertinent to the mining and mineral resources sector, encompassing areas such as business strategies, economic implications, and environmental considerations. These subjects are essential for understanding the broader context of mining but do not directly involve AI methodologies or data science techniques, which typically emphasize computational algorithms, statistical analysis, and machine learning applications.

Despite their classification as "Other," both courses share a commonality in their emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches to mining and mineral resources. They aim to equip students with a holistic understanding of the industry, integrating knowledge from various fields such as economics and environmental science. This interdisciplinary focus is crucial for students who will navigate complex challenges in the mining sector, but it inherently distances these courses from the core AI and data science categories, which are more technical and computational in nature.

Regarding potential misclassification, it appears that these courses are appropriately categorized as "Other." Their content does not align with the core or applied AI and data science frameworks, which are centered around data manipulation, algorithm development, and AI applications. However, if any of the courses were to incorporate significant elements of data analysis or AI applications in the context of mining, they might warrant reconsideration for classification within the applied data science category. As it stands, the current classification accurately reflects their focus and content.
